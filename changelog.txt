 - Fix/Feature: Make grf decoding more verbose when encountering errors. Also do not treat every error as fatal error. This allows decoding of certain 'invalid' grfs out there.
 - Fix: UTF-8 handling was wrong for custom ActionB messages. (glx)

Version 0.5 - 2008-03-25
 - Update to current NewGrfSpecs:
     Add PatchVariables 0x12 and 0x13.
     Add bridge properties 0x10, 0x11 and 0x12.
 - Preliminary support of the preliminary NewAirports specs.
 - Feature: Make links to Action1 sets and Action2s bidirectional.
 - Feature: Add a new frame ("entity"-frame) to group actions, which refer to the same ID of the same feature.
 - Feature: Add some new command line options:
     Allow setting an output-path.
     Allow restricting the output to a specific sprite range. (useful for big files)
     Generate data files (images, etc) only for a specific sprite range. (like "--nodata", but only inside a range)
 - Feature: Add lots of ini file options (in addition to the usual command line options):
     Enable/disable the two frames on the left.
     Enable/disable omitting of subsprites (e.g. images in Action1/5/A/12, sound data) from the left index-frame.
     Specify if transparent-blue should be displayed as blue or as "real" transparency.
     Ability to modify some magic contants used while generating the output, like pixel-widths of various html-elements in the output.
 - Feature: Improve readabilty of various actions:
     Print signed values of Action0 properties as signed numbers.
     Nicer bracket placement in AdvVarAct2.
     Compute var1A constants and insert them directly.
     Print range of used random bits in RandomAction2.
     Make ActionD print constants as signed/unsigned decimal numbers in some cases, instead of always hex.
     Place a space after the '#' of spritenumbers.
     Make background of spritelayout-previews transparent, instead of white.
 - Change: The command line parsing is now more tollerant towards spaces in some places.

 - Change: Nicer output for BasicAction2 of Canals
 - Change: Make the operations in AdvancedVarAction2 and ActionD more readable by putting the "[signed]" etc. in a subscript.
 - Change: Nicer output for empty Action1/5/A/12 and empty Action0ByteArray (like HouseCargoAcceptanceWatchList or IndustryRandomSoundEffects)
 - Fix: Positions of bounding boxes in sprite layouts are signed. (George)
 - Fix: ActionB <data> field now handles UTF-8 correctly. (Though the <UTF-8> control code looks a bit missplaced in the output).

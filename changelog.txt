 - Feature: Make links to Action1 sets and Action2s bidirectional.
 - Feature: Add a new frame ("entity"-frame) to group actions, which refer to the same ID of the same feature.
 - Feature: Add some new command line options:
     Allow setting an output-path.
     Allow restricting the output to a specific sprite range. (useful for big files)
     Generate data files (images, etc) only for a specific sprite range. (like "--nodata", but only inside a range)
 - Feature: Add lots of ini file options (in addition to the usual command line options):
     Enable/disable the two frames on the left.
     Enable/disable omitting of subsprites (e.g. images in Action1/5/A/12, sound data) from the left index-frame.
     Specify if transparent-blue should be displayed as blue or as "real" transparency.
     Ability to modify some magic contants used while generating the output, like pixel-widths of various html-elements in the output.
 - Feature: Improve readabilty of various actions:
     Print signed values of Action0 properties as signed numbers.
     Nicer bracket placement in AdvVarAct2.
     Compute var1A constants and insert them directly.
     Print range of used random bits in RandomAction2.
     Make ActionD print constants as signed/unsigned decimal numbers in some cases, instead of always hex.
     Place a space after the '#' of spritenumbers.
     Make background of spritelayout-previews transparent, instead of white.
